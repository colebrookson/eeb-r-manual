# Evaluation Proposal

**Date:** 2022-05-31

**Author:** Cole Brookson

To better understand how the R Manual can be optimized to assist student learning and success, it would be useful to have a plan in place for evaluating the usefulness of the program, as well as areas for improvement. Since BIO255 will be the first course that the R Manual is trialed in, that class could be a great case study for rolling out an evaluation procedure. 

Here outlined are a number of options to consider for discussion surrounding an evaluation procedure: 

### Evaluation Options

There are two main types of evaluation that I think could be used here - a quantitative assessment and and a sociologically-styled interview-based assessment. 

#### Quantitative Evaluation

Quantitative evaluation could be thought about on a scale from 1-3, with 1 being the set of options that would be the most work but also yield the lowest quality and quantity of data, and 3 yielding the highest of both.
