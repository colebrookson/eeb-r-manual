# Steps to Start Apache and get it going
* run `sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start` that will start the apache server
* go to https::localhost/
* the files for the testing website live in https::localhost/test/html
* this is where we need to look for the files to move back and forth from the tracked repo 
* any changes made there need to be fed back to the eeb repo and vice versa
