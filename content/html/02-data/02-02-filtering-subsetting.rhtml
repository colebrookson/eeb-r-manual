        <h2>Filtering &amp; Subsetting Data</h2>
        <p>
            To filter or subset data is to take a dataframe or some other object, and select only part of that object based on some criteria. Most commonly we want to make a new dataframe from an existing dataframe, by filtering the rows of the dataframe based on one or more column. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As with all things data, we provide an option to perform the task using <strong>base R</strong> functions, as well as in the <strong>Tidyverse</strong>. 
        </p>

          <p class="p-text-box">Why have we written <code class="code-text-box">lterdatasampler::pie_crab</code> here? Writing the package name and the <code class="code-text-box">::</code> operation tells R which <a href="../01-basicr/01-05-packages.html">namespace</a> to look in for the object we're trying to use during our assignment statement!</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            We will use an example dataset here: 
        </p>
            <!--begin.rcode, message=FALSE
            # remotes package is needed to get the most recent version of the package
            install.packages("remotes")
            # install package
            remotes::install_github("lter/lterdatasampler")

            library(lterdatasampler)
            library(tidyverse)
            end.rcode-->
            <p>
            If we want to filter a dataset based on a single value in a column, we can make use of Boolean operators.
            </p>
            <!--begin.rcode
            # first call the dataset from the lterdatasampler package
            crabs <- lterdatasampler::pie_crab
            end.rcode-->
            <p>
              
            Let's look at the columns
            </p>
            <!--begin.rcode
            # this will show us the first six rows
            head(crabs)
            end.rcode-->
            <p>
            We see there is a column called <code>site</code>. We can get the unique values of that column:
            </p>
            <!--begin.rcode
            unique(crabs$site)
            end.rcode-->
            <p>
            So we might want to filter our data such that we have a new dataframe, where <code>site</code> is <strong>only</strong> equal to "VCR". 
        </p>
        <section id="filter--single--core">
            <h5><strong>base R</strong></h5>
            <p>
                Filtering in base R makes use of the square bracket indexing discussed elsewhere. Recall that the index goes [<em>row, column</em>]. In the <em>row</em> position, we use the <code>which()</code> function, which simply returns where some indices are TRUE. Since we want to keep all the columns in our dataset, we leave the <code>column</code> position empty, indicating that all columns should be retained. In our example that looks like this: 
                <br>
                <!--begin.rcode
                vcr_crabs <- crabs[which(crabs$site == "VCR"),]
                end.rcode-->
                <br>
                We can check it worked by calling <code>unique()</code> on the new dataframe as above:
                <br>
                <!--begin.rcode
                unique(vcr_crabs$site)
                end.rcode-->
                <br>
                And we can see it worked as expected.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="filter--single--tidy">
            <h5><strong>Tidyverse</strong></h5>
            <p>
                Filtering in the Tidyverse uses mostly the <code>dplyr</code> package, which is EXTREMELY useful for most data management exercises. Here we use the aptly named <code>filter()</code> function to perform the operation. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to make the best use of the Tidyverse, we need to the <code>%>%</code> operator, which we call a "pipe". It's actually from a Tidyverse package called <code>magrittr</code> and is used to pass or "pipe" an object forward to a function or expression call. Think of it in terms of a "workflow" with "pipelines" of analysis and data manipulation. Why is an operator like <code>%>%</code> all that beneficial? It seems annoying at first, but actually semantically changes your code in a way that makes it more intuitive to both read and write. If you're interested, you can find out more about the pipe, and other <code>magrittr</code> functions in the <a href="https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html">package docs</a>.
            </p>
                <!--begin.rcode
                vc_crabs <- crabs %>% 
                  dplyr::filter(site == "VCR")
                end.rcode-->
            <p>
                The <code>%>%</code>pipe operator is being used to pass the original data frame object <code>crabs</code> to our function, <code>filter()</code>, and the Boolean operator <code>==</code> is the only argument needed for this function. 
            </p>

        <h3>Filter Based on <code>%in%</code> Operator</h3>
            <p>
                There are many permutations of this single value option with Boolean operators. For example, using either approach, we could filter asking R to select rows where <code>site == "VCR" | site == "BC"</code> which would select rows where the site was either "VCR" or "BC". 

                In the case where we had a separate vector dictating the focal sites we were interested in, we could use that vector in combination with the <code>%in%</code> operator to deal with this: 
            </p>
            <h5><strong>base R</strong></h5>
            <!--begin.rcode
            focal_sites <- c("ZI", "RC", "VCR", "DB", "JC")

            focal_crabs <- crabs[which(crabs$site %in% focal_sites),]
            end.rcode-->
            <h5><strong>Tidyverse</strong></h5>
            <!--begin.rcode
            focal_sites <- c("ZI", "RC", "VCR", "DB", "JC")

            focal_crabs <- crabs %>% 
            dplyr::filter(site %in% focal_sites)
            end.rcode-->
      </section>
      <section id="filter--multiple">
        <p>
            This filtering can be extended to use multiple columns relatively simply. There is a variable in this dataset called size. 
            <!--begin.rcode
            hist(crabs$size)
            end.rcode-->
            We may want to filter crabs only in our focal sites, but also those above some size (e.g. 15).
        </p>
        <h5><strong>base R</strong></h5>
        <!--begin.rcode
        site_size <- crabs[which(crabs$site %in% focal_sites & 
                                crabs$size > 15), ]
        end.rcode-->
        <h5><strong>Tidyverse</strong></h5>
        <!--begin.rcode
        site_size <- crabs %>% 
        dplyr::filter(site %in% focal_sites & size > 15)
        end.rcode-->
        <hr>
        <p>
            Here we just use another logical operator, <code>&amp;</code> to link our two conditions together. We can double check:
            <br>
            <!--begin.rcode
            hist(site_size$size)
            unique(site_size$site)
            end.rcode-->
            <br>
            So we can see it worked well. 
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section id="na">
        <h3>Filtering out <em>NA</em>s</h3>
        <p>
            For this example, we will use a different dataset.
            <!--begin.rcode
            ice <- lterdatasampler::ntl_icecover
            head(ice)
            end.rcode-->
            We can see already that there will be some values of <code>ice_duration</code> that will have values of <em>NA</em>. To filter those out of the dataset, we can use the <code>is.na()</code> function:
        </p>
        <h5><strong>base R</strong></h5>
        <!--begin.rcode
        trimmed_ice <- ice[which(!is.na(ice$ice_duration)),]
        end.rcode-->
        <p>
            Again, we want to keep all the columns present.
        </p>
        <h5><strong>Tidyverse</strong></h5>
        <!--begin.rcode
        trimmed_ice <- ice %>% 
        dplyr::filter(!is.na(ice_duration))
        end.rcode-->
        <hr>
        <p>
            Here we use the combination of the <code>!</code> and <code>is.na()</code> to first find the positions where the value is equal to <em>NA</em>, and then to remove them with the <code>!</code>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Any conceivable set of criteria can be strung together (carefully!) to filter a dataset with as many conditions as necessary. It is always a good idea however when you are just beginning to use these functions, to work piece by piece, adding conditions one at a time and testing each one to make sure it's doing what you want. Then you can string multiple conditions together without worrying that an error is not being caught. 
        </p>
