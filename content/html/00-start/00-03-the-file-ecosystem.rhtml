<h1>The File Ecosystem</h1>
<p>
    There are a core set of files that R uses that you'll likely run into and 
    want to know the meaning of. 
</p>
<section id=".R">
    <h2><code>.R</code></h2>
    <p>
        The base of the programming language, the <code>.R</code> file is the 
        simplest and most commonly used file for writing a program in R. A set of 
        commands in the file, executed in order by the computer, provides the user 
        with a reproducible way of repeating an analysis. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In <code>.R</code> files, all written text is assumed to be written in the 
        syntax and language of R, such as this: 
    </p>
    <!--begin.rcode 
        x <- 2 + 2
        print("x is ", x)
        end.rcode-->
    <p>
        To write comments or notes to yourself or other future users of the file, 
        use the pound symbol or "hashtag" (#) to tell R to ignore that part of the 
        text. 
        <br><br>
        <em>Example:</em>
    
        If we wanted to leave ourselves a comment telling us what our code will do we 
        could write 
        
    </p>
    <!--begin.rcode 
        x <- 2 + 2
        # print the value of x to the console
        print(x) 
        end.rcode-->
</section>
<section id=".rmd">
    <h2><code>.Rmd</code></h2>

    <p>
        The <code>.rmd</code> file is a special hybrid between an R file <code>.R</code> and a markdown file <code>.md</code>. This file type gives us flexibility to use both R programming, and write in a normal text editor document like a Microsoft Word doc. Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for creating formatted text. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In short, we can write both normal text (such as methods or results), *and* include chunks of code in the same file. This is very handy for writing reports and assignments.
    </p>
    <p>
        To include an R code chunk in a <code>.rmd</code> file, we must put the R code inside a special set of characters that looks like this: 
    
    </p>
    <img class="image-full-page" style="display:block;margin:auto"
    src="../img//00-img/rmarkdown-chunk.png">
    <img>
</section>
<section id="rproj">
    <h2><code>.Rproj</code></h2>
    <p>
        The last important file you'll use once you're more familiar with R is the <code>.rproj</code> file. This file formats an R Project, which is a component of ensuring a reproducible analysis. This file acts to store information about your <a href="../01-basicr/01-06-workflow.html">R Project</a>, as well as point to the directory you have stored your analysis in. This file can also be used as a shortcut for opening the project directly from the filesystem. More about this file type can be found in R Projects.
