# Components Present in Each Section

## Round 1

These items would be the first things created for the content in each section - the sort of "bare bones" version so to speak.

**1. Written content**

This is the written descriptions of all the subjects covered in each section

**2. Code snippets**

Example code (copyable) that illustrates the concept at hand - this is not an exhaustive program but pieces that show an output that are examples of how something is performed

**3. Images of output/objects**

Essential pictures to communicate where the students should be directing their attention (i.e. the environment, the console, etc.)

**4. Summary & "Understanding Check" Sections**

In each subsection there will be "Understanding Checks" that are optional for the students to see if they're on the right path or not - it will be a short problem or a question they can click on to see the answer to. Each overall section will have a summary that reviews the essential material. 

## Round 2

These items would only be created *after* the initial content is created and can be used and also receive feedback from students.
