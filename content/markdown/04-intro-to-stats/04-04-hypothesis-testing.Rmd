Hypothesis testing is the process of testing, with statistical rigor, some suggested assumption about an observation. This process follows the the process of: 

1) Making some testable assumption
2) Collecting data to use as evidence of said assumption
3) Accepting or rejecting the assumption at hand 

## Null Hypothesis Testing 

This is the simplest form of hypothesis testing, and it revolves around the idea of a <strong>null hypothesis</strong>, which is held the accepted truth until proven otherwise, using a <strong>alternate hypothesis</strong>. The null hypothesis states no statistical relationship and significance exists between two sets of observed data. The alternate hypothesis <strong> does </strong> suggest a statistical relationship between the sets of data, and can optionally also suggest a direction of magnitude. That is, the alternate hypothesis can suggest only a magnitude (e.g. X variable co-varies with Y) or a magnitude <strong>and</strong> a direction (e.g. X co-varies positively with Y). 

Once we have a stated alternate and null hypothesis, we would perform a statistical test to determine whether or not we <strong>reject</strong> the null hypothesis. <strong>Importantly, note that we can NEVER accept the alternate hypothesis. We can ONLY reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.</strong> Typically we would use a significance value to determine whether or not we can reject the null hypothesis. 

The way that we state our hypothesis will determine what type of statistical test we use to determine whether or not we reject this null hypothesis. Among the types of tests we can perform, in the context of a null hypothesis test, we can ask about:

1) A single variable
2) Association/Co-variation between variables
3) Differences between group means

Let's use an example to discuss this. Say we are interested in the size of fiddler crabs. We could formulate a hypothesis test that falls into each of these categories. For example: 

1) Say we believe that the distribution of sizes is not in fact normal. We could construct a null hypothesis that says we believe our size data to be drawn from a population distribution that is in fact normally distributed, and the alternate hypothesis would say that the data were drawn from a non-normal distribution. <strong>Note here that we have not made any suggestion in our alternate hypothesis as to what specifically that non-normal distribution is</strong>.

2) We could decide we think that size covaries with some other variable, say, latitude. If we wanted to test Bergmann's Rule, we could form a null hypothesis that says that size does not co-vary with latitude, and an alternate hypothesis that says not only do we think size co-varies with lattitude, but that it co-varies <em>positively</em>. 

3) If the crabs are from multiple sites, we could say that, between two sites of interest, we might believe there to be a size difference. Here, we would then state as our null hypothesis that there is no difference in the mean between the group of population at site A) and site B), but our alternate hypothesis would say that there is in fact a statistically significant difference between the group means at site A) and B).
