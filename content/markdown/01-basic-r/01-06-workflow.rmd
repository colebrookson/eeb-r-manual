# Workflow in R
**Author:** Cole Brookson
**Date:** 02 July 2022 

This section will take you through a set of best practices for optimizing your daily workflow in R. <strong>NOTE:</strong> This will progress from beginner topics to more advanced usage, so please only operationalize from this section what is relevant to you. 

For this section, we assume you're familiar with R scripts and `.Rmd` files, packages, and some basic programming, including reading in data to R. 

## Workflow for ALL Users

Even if you are a beginner, there are some basics to keep in mind that will make your life SO much easier down the road. 

### Workspace

You will likely have multiple files for the same project, whether lab report or publication. All scripts, data files, figures, and outputs, should be contained in the same place on your computer. 

Imagine you work on an analysis on Tuesday, close R, shut down your computer, and want to begin working on it again on Wednesday. On Tuesday you might have created a bunch of objects in your script, that were saved in your environment. <strong>However, it is best practice to NOT save those objects in your environment until Wednesday.</strong> By structuring your R scripts and data files properly, you can recreate your environment safely each time, without having to worry about whether or not you are keeping any intermediate objects or things by accident. To make sure you do this, change your RStudio settings to not preserve your workspace (environment) in between sessions.

This will be annoying at first, but it will encourage better habits in the long run. 

The idea behind a working directory is that there will be one single place where R looks for files to load or to write out to your computer. You can see your current working directory with: 
<!--begin.rcode
getwd()
end.rcode-->
When you are beginning, I recommend you make a folder in your `Documents` folder or some such place named something easily memorable such as `r-work`. Then, within that location, make sub-folders for each project you may work on. For example, within your `r-work` folder, you may have a subfolder for each class you're taking that requires R (i.e. a path like: `/Documents/r-work/eeb225/`), within which you should have additional folders such as `data`, and `code`. 

This way when you open up a new RStudio session, you can *set your working directory* using: 
<!--begin.rcode
setwd("...../Documents/r-work/eeb225/")
end.rcode-->
And now if you want to load in any data, you could just write something like 
<!--begin.rcode
read.csv("./data/lab-1-data.csv")
end.rcode-->
and R would know that it should look for the relevant file in the `/data` file of `/eeb225`. This is very useful and important to thing carefully about. 

**However**, as soon as you are more comfortable in R, you should **NEVER** use the `setwd()` function, and should instead use `RProjects` as described below. While this approach may seem simple and foolproof, it is actually very easy to get confused, and is **not** recommended past the first few usages of R. 

#### RProjects and the `here` Package

Instead of using `setwd()`, there is a simple and even more foolproof solution to linking all your related files together. One can very simply make a new project. In RStudio, click File > New Project then select "New Directory" if you do not have a directory for this set of files yet. If you DO, you can select existing directory. 

![](./img/project-wizard.png)

Now, select "New Project"

![](./img/new-project.png)

And then name the project: 

![](./img/name-project.png)
Use a simple and reasonable name. If I want to make a project for a class, it might be easiest to name it after the course code. Then, to select your subdirectory, select "Browse..." and click through to the location you want (we recommend putting a folder called `r-work` inside your `Documents` folder), like this: 

![](./img/directory.png)

And select the `r-work` folder (for this example). Now we can see the project is ready to create!

![](./img/ready-to-create.png)
Now simply select "Create Project" to complete the process. Once you do this, RStudio will re-open a new session with that project opened. We can see this in the top right hand corner by the environment: 

![](./img/new-project-opened.png)

And now our project is all set up and ready to go! If we want to check that it has worked, we can ask R to `getwd()`, and we see the output is exactly what we expected: 

![](./img/working-directory.png)


Once you have your RProject set up, it's time to write some code. So within your `/r-work/eeb225`, make a new folder called, say, `code`, and save a new RMarkdown file there that might be for your first lab. That might look like this: 

![](./img/folder.png)
And here we see we now have our RProject (`.Rproj` file) and our folder for code, inside which is 

![](./img/code-folder.png)
Where we see our file. Note how it is named with numbers at the beginning. See below in the Style Guide for why this is. 

Now let's assume you might get some data for this lab from your TA (i.e. a file called `lab-1-data.csv`) that you'll need to work on the assignment(s). This is where the `here` package comes in. 

If we have a second subfolder in our directory called `data` and within that is our file like this: 

![](./img/data-dir.png)

We will want to be able to access that file reliably. In fact, at some point we might even want to send the whole directory (i.e. the whole `eeb225` folder) to someone else, maybe the TA or in the future a collaborator, so they can run it all themselves. 

**This presents a challenge.**

In our new file, 

Whoever you may want to send your project to may not use the same operating system as you (i.e. Mac OS vs. Windows vs. Linux), and they may keep their files in a different place than you. If we used an *absolute* path in our code to read in this data file (something like, "C:/Users/Student1/Documents/r-work/eeb225"), then no one else would be able to use this code, since no one else will have the same absolute path as we do. 

A good solution to this is the `here` package. This package helps us ignore absolute paths, in that the package itself will identify the relevant absolute path for your individual machine, so you only have to specify the *relative path*, that is, the path from the directory to whatever file you refer to. 

If we used an *absolute* path to read in this file, using the tidyverse, our `00-lab-01.Rmd` file may look like this: 

![](./img/absolute-path.png)
But this wouldn't work for another user! So, we use the `here` package. 

##### `here` Package
First we need to install the package: 
<!--begin.rcode
install.packages("here")
end.rcode-->
Now we can edit our file to read in the data using the `here()` function. To see how it works, run just `here()` in your console, and you'll notice that it prints the absolute path to the root of your directory! This is the magic of this package! When used along with an RProject, it provides a near-perfect reproducibility across computers and operating systems! 

So our edited file would look something like this: 

![](./img/here-path.png)
And this works perfectly! Notice what happens if we run just the `here::here()` function: 

![](./img/here.png)
And we see it prints out the absolute path pointing to our current working directory! So when we use the `here()` function, we put in quotation marks, first "./" which signifies everything printed above that the package is taking care of for us, and then the relative path to the file we want, so in our case, "data/lab-1-data.csv"

## Workflow for Advanced Users

Once you are comfortable working in R, you will be served well by continuing to develop strong workflow practices that will make your work more reproducible, and closer to professional-quality code. One thing to consider is beginning to regularly use style guide components. 

### Style Guide

When writing code and managing files, it's always best to use consistent style. The best way to do so is to follow a style guide as closely as possible. 

This style guide is based largely off the [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/), and much of the style guidelines here are copied and pasted directly. This assumes you are using the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) language and likely the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) IDE. It is recommended that you read through and follow the [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) but **there are five key components of the style guide, *Files, Syntax, Functions, Pipes, `ggplot2`***, and key components of each are highlighted here: 

#### **Files**
  * Organization
    * File names should be meaningful and end in .R. Avoid using special characters in file names - stick with numbers, letters, -, and _.
    * If files should be run in a particular order, prefix them with numbers. If it seems likely you’ll have more than 10 files, left pad with zero:
    end.rcode-->
    00_download.R
    01_explore.R
    ...
    09_model.R
    10_visualize.R
    end.rcode-->
    * Pay attention to capitalization, since you, or some of your collaborators, might be using an operating system with a case-insensitive file system (e.g., Microsoft Windows or OS X) which can lead to problems with (case-sensitive) revision control systems. Prefer file names that are all lower case, and never have names that differ only in their capitalization.
  * Internal Structure
   * Use commented lines of - and = to break up your file into easily readable chunks.
   end.rcode-->
   # Load data ===========================

   # Plot data ===========================
   end.rcode-->
   * If your script uses add-on packages, load them all at once at the very beginning of the file. This is more transparent than sprinkling library() calls throughout your code or having hidden dependencies that are loaded in a startup file, such as .Rprofile.

#### **Syntax**
  * Object Names
    * Variable and function names should use only lowercase letters, numbers, and _. Use underscores (_) (so called snake case) to separate words within a name.
    * Base R uses dots in function names (`contrib.url()`) and class names (`data.frame`), but it’s better to reserve dots exclusively for the S3 object system. In S3, methods are given the name `function.class`; if you also use . in function and class names, you end up with confusing methods like `as.data.frame.data.frame()`
    * Where possible, avoid re-using names of common functions and variables. This will cause confusion for the readers of your code.
  * Long Lines
    * Strive to limit your code to 80 characters per line. This fits comfortably on a printed page with a reasonably sized font. If you find yourself running out of room, this is a good indication that you should encapsulate some of the work in a separate function.
    * If a function call is too long to fit on a single line, use one line each for the function name, each argument, and the closing ). This makes the code easier to read and to change later.
   end.rcode-->
   # Good
   do_something_very_complicated(
    something = "that",
    requires = many,
    arguments = "some of which may be long"
   )
  
   # Bad
   do_something_very_complicated("that", requires, many, arguments,
                                "some of which may be long"
                                )
  end.rcode-->
  * Comments
    * Each line of a comment should begin with the comment symbol and a single space: #
    * In data analysis code, use comments to record important findings and analysis decisions. If you need comments to explain what your code is doing, consider rewriting your code to be clearer. 

#### **Functions**
  * Naming
    * As well as following the general advice for object names, strive to use verbs for function names:
    end.rcode-->
    # Good
    add_row()
    permute()
    
    # Bad
    row_adder()
    permutation()
    end.rcode-->
  * Long lines
    * If a function definition runs over multiple lines, indent the second line to where the definition starts.
    end.rcode-->
    # Good
    long_function_name <- function(a = "a long argument",
                                   b = "another argument",
                                   c = "another long argument") {
      # As usual code is indented by two spaces.
    }
  
    # Bad
    long_function_name <- function(a = "a long argument",
      b = "another argument",
      c = "another long argument") {
      # Here it's hard to spot where the definition ends and the
      # code begins
    }
    end.rcode-->
  * Comments
    * In code, use comments to explain the “why” not the “what” or “how”. Each line of a comment should begin with the comment symbol and a single space: #.
    end.rcode-->
    # Good

    # Objects like data frames are treated as leaves
    x <- map_if(x, is_bare_list, recurse)
    
    # Bad
    
    # Recurse only with bare lists
    x <- map_if(x, is_bare_list, recurse)
    end.rcode--> 
#### **Pipes**
  * Long Lines 
    *  If the arguments to a function don’t all fit on one line, put each argument on its own line and indent:
    end.rcode-->
    iris %>%
     group_by(Species) %>%
     summarise(
       Sepal.Length = mean(Sepal.Length),
       Sepal.Width = mean(Sepal.Width),
       Species = n_distinct(Species)
     )
    end.rcode-->
#### **`ggplot2`**
   * Whitespace
     * `+` should always have a space before it, and should be followed by a new line. This is true even if your plot has only two layers. After the first step, each line should be indented by two spaces
   * Long lines
     * If the arguments to a ggplot2 layer don’t all fit on one line, put each argument on its own line and indent:
     end.rcode-->
     # Good
     ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +
       geom_point() +
       labs(
         x = "Sepal width, in cm",
         y = "Sepal length, in cm",
         title = "Sepal length vs. width of irises"
       ) 
     
     # Bad
     ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +
       geom_point() +
       labs(x = "Sepal width, in cm", y = "Sepal length, in cm", title = "Sepal length vs. width of irises") 
     end.rcode-->
     * ggplot2 allows you to do data manipulation, such as filtering or slicing, within the data argument. Avoid this, and instead do the data manipulation in a pipeline before starting plotting.
     end.rcode-->
     # Good
     iris %>%
       filter(Species == "setosa") %>%
       ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length)) +
       geom_point()
     
     # Bad
     ggplot(filter(iris, Species == "setosa"), aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length)) +
       geom_point()
     end.rcode-->
     
### Efficient Workflow

Another thing to begin doing when you're more comfortable in R is to begin to think more critically about a project *before* you just start writing code. There are many excellent books on writing good code more generally, but [Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/) by Gillespie & Lovelace may be a good starting point. To summarize a few short important points from their work, Gillespie & Lovelace list [five top tips for efficient workflow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/efficient-r-programming/9781491950777/ch04.html) that are worth considering: 

1. Start without writing code but with a clear mind and perhaps a pen and paper. This will ensure that you keep your objectives at the forefront of your mind without getting lost in the technology.

2. Make a plan. The size and nature will depend on the project but timelines, resources, and chunking the work will make you more effective when you start.

3. Select the packages you will use for implementing the plan early. Minutes spent researching and selecting from the available options could save hours in the future.

4. Document your work at every stage: work can only be effective if it’s communicated clearly and code can only be efficiently understood if it’s commented.

5. Make your entire workflow as reproducible as possible. knitr can help with this in the phase of documentation.
